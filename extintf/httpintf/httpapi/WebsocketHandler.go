/*

	swagger:route GET /ws feature-flag pilot global websocket Websocket

	Socket API to check release flag Status

	This endpoint currently meant to used by servers and not by clients.
	The  reason behind is that it is much more easy to calculate with server quantity,
	than with client quantity, and therefore the load balancing is much more deterministic for the service.
	The websocket based communication allows for servers to do low latency quick requests,
	which is ideal to check flag status for individual requests that the server receives.
	Because the nature of the persistent connection, TCP connection overhead is minimal.
	The endpoint able to serve back whether the feature for a given pilot id is enabled or not.
	The endpoint also able to serve back global flag state checks as well.
	The flag enrollment interpretation use the same logic as it is described in the documentation.
